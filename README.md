# Tasks
Tasks Project

Vague Idea is to build an application which is Usable for managing projects.
You can use whatever tools you want, whatever languages you want. The basic design of the project is at the design_base_0.00 branch.
The base project, which is an android app is in base_0.00.
It need not necessarily be an android app. You can also build a website, Desktop application or any kind of application which will provide the same functionality as mentioned.
Feel free to use whatever tools and softwares you like.



Note - While making the app, please fork it to your library or create a diffrent branch with your username_branchName and push all the changes to that branch. It will be your "master" Branch.
If you want to create another branch, create it from the branch you created instead of the master branch of the project.


Have Fun.
