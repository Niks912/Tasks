# Tasks
Tasks Project

Vague Idea is to build an application which is Usable for managing projects.

You can use whatever tools you want, whatever languages you want. The basic design of the project is at the design_base_0.00 branch.

The base project, which is an android app is in base_0.00.

The project you are going to build need not necessarily be an android app. You can also build a website, Desktop application or any kind of application which will provide the same functionality as mentioned.

Feel free to use whatever tools and softwares you like.



Note -

1>> While making the app, please fork it to your library or create a diffrent branch with your username_branchName and push all the changes to that branch. It will be your "master" Branch.

2>> If you want to create another branch, create it from the branch you created instead of the master branch of the project.

3>> For viewing design more efficiently, I suggest using the Adobe XD program. Download link - https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/xd?promoid=BRLW38VW&mv=other

4>> If you are not able to download the XD, Please refer to the branch "design_base_0.00_components" branch for viewing snapshots of the sample design.


Have Fun.
